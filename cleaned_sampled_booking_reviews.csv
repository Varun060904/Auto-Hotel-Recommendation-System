Everything in the rooms, furniture, towels, looks old, there was no fridge. The breakfast was also disappointing: the choice was very poor, the quality of food is not perfect either.

That was the only flaw which I saw - and it leaves an ugly impression as you immediately think that the bathroom and the room are not cleaned properly. But after my thorough (and quite expert :-)) inspectoon, I couldn’t find any other sign of poor cleaning techniques. So, it’s just that it wasn’t cleaned properly at some time and the limescale got built at the parts if the tap that are harder to reach. That is what they need to improve. Everything else was really correct.,

A former cinema building turned into a hotel which explains the film memorabilia as the main decoration theme. The hotel is clean, the room was spacious, the bed and pillows were comfortable. They offered fancy toiletries in the bathroom, the staff is smiling and efficient.",['Business trip~Group~Standard Double or Twin Room~Stayed 2 nights~Submitted via mobile']

It squirts everywhere.
Would have also been good to have small shampoo & conditioner bottles & a shower cap. Only Shower gel in the bath/shower & hand wash at the basin.,

"Cozy, Wooden Cabin on Quiet Farmland.",B&B La ferme du Château de Broich,9.1,Greece,9.0,"Two Items for Improvement1.) The cabins are set on ""Pet Friendly"". This is taken to mean by the guests that the pets are welcome in the accommodation. We were not sure the host understood this. He stated that pets should sleep in the car. The temperature was -1 C out so that was not an option. If they are uncomfortable with pets or are unhappy with the state of the cabins after a pet stay they should change this setting to indicate ""No Pets"". 2.) The owner wants 100Euro deposit (IN CASH) on arrival. This is understandable and we had no problem. However they owner should say this very clearly in the advertisement up front. Now it is buried in the ""policies"" which many do not read. Many people are not in the habit of traveling with that much cash these days and they might be cut short. We only knew because we asked about the check in procedures and he mentioned it in passing. Otherwise we would not have known.,

The farm is quiet and peaceful set outside of town. The cabins are new, very clean and very comfortable. I would recommend that they are ideal for no more than two persons especially during bad weather.  The host was very friendly and check in was quick and easy. The breakfast was very nice and taken in our cabin. All was provided beforehand in the refrigerator and cupboard. Many of the ingredients were home made and were very very nice.

Very poor,Smartflats Design - Antwerp Central,7.1,Netherlands,1.0,"My review starts with our arrival. All the necessary info regarding our stay was communicated in time and clearly. At arrival at the accommodation the code that was communicated with us was incorrect. Apparently this was not just with us, but with all other people staying. Therefore we were left standing in the rain with our stuff for ten minutes waiting for a whatsapp message with the correct code to enter the building. When entering the apartment we were just simply shocked.- The floors were dirty and sticky;- The tables and kitchen counter were sticky and smelly;- The couch was full of dust and feathers sticking out all over which makes sitting on the couch painful;- The lights in the bathroom were hanging on wires out of the sealing and only one of them was working, therefor there was barely any light in the shower;- The sinks in the bathroom would not drain the water out. Therefore we were stuck with a dirty combination of water and toothpaste in the sinks for the whole weekend;- The amount of water coming out of the shower was just enough to get your toes wet. Showering or taking a bath was extremely unpleasant;- The bath was sticky and smelly. Clearly not cleaned;- There was a bad sewer smell throughout the whole apartment, but especially in the bathroom;- The elevator in the building could not take the heavy rainfall. Therefore we could not make use of the elevator, making us climb the stairs for four floors. Can happen, but no one gave us a call or came by to apologize for this;- The bed in the bedroom was smelly and left me with bites of bedbugs. A terrible stay at Smartflats Antwerp Central for us in apartment 4001.After sending this review to Smartflats directly all we got was an automated an unpersonalised email giving us a 15% discount for a next stay.,

Restaurant located in the basement, it feels dark & filthy in there. I was charged circa 10% extra to the booking.com rate as explained by hotel it's due to currency difference. Room prices are set in USD, whilst normally you expected to pay in local currency. This reminds me of the era right after  Soviet Union collapsed. When everything in CIS countries was traded and sold in USD. Not much has changed in Belarus since that time, it's still stuck in post Soviet times.Soap is limited  to 2 portions per person. I would be keen to learn, how are you suppose to shower and wash you hands throughout the day with that amount?Window's  sound insulation on the top floor is terrible, can hear motorway all night long.,

Nothing really I liked about the hotel. Maybe just the proximity to the motorway.

Eurocidatin lies near to the center of Ixelles, a lively spot inmid of Brussels. Bus connections towards the center are all fine (bus-stop for No. 71 is only 5 minutes walk, and the bus 71 takes you to the central station).

Nevertheless we would highly recommend a stay in this hotel.,

We enjoyed our stay at the  Century Hotel from the 12th to 18th February.  On arrival we received a very friendly welcome from Suhail. He explained that since we were early, he would check if a room was ready and asked if we would mind waiting for 5 – 10 mins. After a very short time he was able to give us a key card and told us that we would staying at the 9th floor where they had just fitted new showers and mattresses. The room was clean and tidy and the beds were very comfortable.The breakfast was particularly  good for a budget hotel:  good choice of hot breakfast items, healthy options, and nice Flemish breakfast items and plenty of fresh fruit.A little research shows that the hotel was built in the 1920s for the Antwerp World Exhibition in 1930. On the first floor there’s a long nice breakfast room overlooking the iconic central station.The hotel’s position in very central to the tourist and shopping attractions that Antwerp has to offer.

Has not happened to me in a very long time. Another one is less of a hotel fault, but since there was a question on area/security, i think it is quite important. We parked our car right next to the hotel, between two nice cafes even. Overnight the car windows were broken, car opened, and quite a few things stolen from the car (we just moved to Belgium, our first night there, so could not empty the car fully obviously).,

It was fine. The bathroom was unacceptable.,Dansaert Hotel,8.0,Netherlands,7.0,"The reception staff were merely adequate, not very polite and certainly not friendly (very noticeable in unfailingly polite and friendly Brussels). The Nespresso (really?) machine is not intuitive to use; it makes noise and produces... nothing. Some posted instructions would help, rather than assume everyone knows how to operate these stupid coffeemakers. Really frustrating in the morning when you really need coffee and the machine seems all form and no function. Also, why was all the heating off in the room and bathroom on a freezing night in January, with giant windows looking onto an internal courtyard? Once the room is reserved, would it take so much to make a pass and turn on the heat so it's not a fridge when the guest arrives in the middle of the night? Highly unpleasant, and not expected at this price point.
HOWEVER. That is nothing compared to THE DEATH-TRAP BATHROOM.
This gloomy cave in dark wall colours and no bulb above 50 lumens is all sharp angles in concrete and tiles, with metal edge strips for added lethal potential. The bathtub/shower comes up to the mid-thigh and there are no handholds anywhere on the walls, making it a lovely treat to anyone with dodgy knees or mobility issues, risking toppling over getting in or out. There is no effective partition, so water sprays everywhere on the slick tile floor, adding another fun ""am I going to die now"" dimension. But the cherry on top is the 2 cm invisible step from the bedroom floor to the bathroom tiled floor. Too low to register in mind's eye, especially in the gloom of the room, but too high for one's foot to miss, especially as it's not expected. It also had a fun metal guillotine edge. I nearly broke my toes four times, getting angrier every time. Plus it made me stumble each time, forward toward the sharp, metal-edged corner of the bathtub. One day someone will trip, fall headlong onto that corner and crack open their forehead. It's absolutely ridiculous. Fix this.,

Wonderful location, basically steps from where I was (the extra night in Brussels was a last-minute decision) and where I wanted to be. The hotel is clean and functional. However, the design is a bit generic ""funky hipster"", like every boutique hotel in the world, which is getting a bit boring. Also: WAY too dark in colour choices, especially at night. You can't really see anything in your room, since they don't seem to believe in bulbs above 50 lumens. But clearly they tried. And it was fine for one night.",['Leisure trip~Solo traveller~Deluxe Room~Stayed 1 night']

Also many things in the hotel were almost broken and badly fixed, so all in the room didn't look cosy. There was no smell of cigarettes or bad taste at all and a bed was very comfortable, I liked it very much... but still, it is a high time for the repairment for this Hotel :),

Actually I don't think that the district is bad somehow - I have'nt seen any danger for myself, no bad people, it's near to a beautiful city centre and there's a supermarket, like, 20 meters away and there is a big botanical garden very close as well :) So, all in all the location is wonderful.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Double Room~Stayed 1 night']

"Our stay Sept 3, 2018",Aux Berges de la Bel,8.3,United States,6.7,"We booked this from the USA Looking for a place to stay near the Henri-Chapelle WWII American veterans cemetery. Nobody was there when we arrived. Luckily our taxi cab driver stayed and contacted a person who came. Next, the facility is advertised as having a restaurant, however, because it was the holiday, the restaurant was closed. Luckily again, the person who came Took us to a restaurant several miles away for evening dinner after we visited the cemetery then arranged for a ride to take us back to the place. It all worked out, but started out scary with the taxi driver driving around forever unable to locate the place, and causing us undue stress limiting our precious time at the cemetery.  I took out my map that I had printed from home and noticed he had driven past the street more than once. I told him so. In the end he reduced the taximeter from 65 Euro to 20, the amount we were quoted as needing from the train station. This was not a good experience but by the grace of God turned out. The taxi driver’s wife returned in the morning to pick us up and take us to the train station. In my opinion and according to others, the taxi driver certainly knew where he was to take us and was trying to soak us for more money Unconcerned that we were there to go to the cemetery. Sad how these people think they can get away with that when they see  foreign travelers.  The motel lady said the driver certainly knew where her place was, but if she knew we were coming, why wasn’t she there when we arrived?  This was a bad experience, And only turned out by the grace of God. If we ever return, we won’t be staying there. Do you blame on us?,

However, that also has its charms. It is an amazingly beautiful area, and very congenial. Seeing all the bicycles with the kinds at their front is in itself a very calming experience. Great all around if you can bear the,

The owner let me know in advance that he was transferring me to another venue than the one which I had booked. It was more central - thus more expensive but he would not change the price. One of the reasons for which I had chosen the original place was that parking was available. This meant a 15-20 minute walk to the new venue but I did not mind that.The new venue was exceptionally good (especially for the price I had paid) though its central location also meant it was less quiet than I had expected. But still an amazing experience. Even at the normal price (which I do not know) I would have rated the service excellent.The breakfast was stupendous and the staff really, really friendly and helpful.",['Business trip~Solo traveller~Double Room with Private Bathroom~Stayed 1 night']

This is not a 4* hotel,Hotel Saint Sauveur by WP Hotels,7.8,Belgium,1.0,"Despite the publication and price range this Is 4* is unworthy.
Hotel is completely outdated and in need of renovation.
Upon arrival the room was not cleaned, fingerprints and hairs of the previous hotel guests were abundant, and this during covid period.
The bathroom was completely worn, mold spots in and around the shower and sink, stains on walls and ceilings, taps worn, rusted and completely calcified. Windows hadn't been cleaned for weeks, the handles were literally black with dirt.
The renovation work already carried out looked more like amateurish bricolage than thorough renovation (laminate simply laid over the old fitted carpet, holes in the walls for extra cabling).
When reported to the counter, the friendliness of the staff quickly deteriorated. A cleaning lady was sent on the spot who apparently lacked a special product (= Antical). Unfortunately she was only in possession of a spray with Javel but would certainly report this to the 'Manager'. A good morning from the staff turned out to be no longer an option. However, the hotel apparently has a rather high reputation when it comes to friendliness of the staff.
Despite the multiple positive scores for breakfast, this was also a disappointment.
A very classic and standard breakfast was offered 'corona proof', but if you wanted a glass of cava, each guest had to take the same bottles to pour themselves during covid. Moreover, the waiter on duty didn't speak the Dutch language. The dining room turned out not to be cleaned either, dust and food remains of previous guests were easily spotted.
This is the first time in 20 years that I am writing a review. However, I have never had such a negative experience (not even in countries where the stars are awarded 'smoother').
Any self-respecting 4* hotel would notice these things for themselves and take action here.

Pretty Place Ruined by Owner/Chef with anger management issues.,Hotel La Ferronniere,8.4,United States,6.3,"The owner/chef Wim(?), ruined our time at this location.  He is a hot head with a chip on his shoulder that ended up being the downfall of our time there as well as two Americans also staying there that we befriended.  As John Paul, our Belgian American friend said ""this guy is really bad for Belgium.""  Not to prolong the misery but the incident arose after we were gifted by Van Steenberg Brewery near Ghent a magnum of our favorite Belgium beer, Tripel de Garre.  We told the staff we wanted to share it with others and the young son showed us we had a fridge in our room.  I then told Wim we met their guests from America and wanted to get some cheeses to offer them when we shared the bottle. Wim directed me to the store.  We met our friends on the public patio outside well away from the B&B and restaurant.  there was no one in the bar or restaurant.  I asked the young worker if we could use four glasses to share the beer and he graciously agreed.  After about 30 minutes of quietly enjoying the view and the beer, Wim stormed onto the public patio, told us we were not allowed to drink our belgium beer there and insisted we leave immediately.  We said OK and started to gather our belongings but Wim shouted ""right now, you must leave immediately!"" He then claimed in 20 years no guest has ever had the audacity to share a beverage on the public patio.  At that point, we had to ask him to calm down as he was acting threatening, but the rant continued.  He even told us about the size of his mortgage as if drinking our gift had deprived him of significant value!  The said thing is our simple celebration with new found friends is not what is depriving him of income.  It is the atrociously sophomoric culinary experience he offers.  It was also the low light of our eating in Belgium.  This guy really should not be in the service or culinary business.  To prove the point, aside from the four of us, only one other couple ever showed up for dinner.,

The place is up a steep hill but accessible if you've got stamina or a car.  The views, especially from our room #2 were dramatic of the city and the Count's Fort.  It had a lovely ""public patio"" (quotes to be explained later) and our room also had a grand outdoor patio.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Superior Double Room~Stayed 2 nights']

Pleasant stay,Motel One Brussels,8.9,Netherlands,8.3,"- Our door was knocked by the cleaning lady for cleaning 3 hours before our check out, which was a bit annoying.- Shower has a window to separate the shower area from the sink, but no doors included. Once you start showering it is highly possible that you will end up with a wet floor- A small fridge/bar in the room would be a nice addition (it is not a negative thing but yet would be nice)- No tea/coffee in the room, and no water boiler,

- Helpful reception staff- Air conditining- Comfortable room- Easy access to the rooms- Very good location: 2 mins to the Royal Palace of Brussels and 10 mins to the center by walking- It was very nice for us to be able to check in earlier than what is mentioned on the website.

It took a few discussions and phone calls to arrange for bottle water instead. The crew was almost irritated by me asking although I had just come out sweaty from the gym. A few tips from my side:
• The tiny sport facility is a separate space. Put a water dispenser there, provide towels and keep it open around the clock! The spa can still be closed independently.
• Train your staff to understand the guests’ needs and think a little bit outside the box. Pay them extra for smiling, talking friendly and looking people in the eyes. 
• Make sure your supplies are efficient and your staff pro-active to keep the guests happy. It doesn’t take much!,

If you have any walking issues, this may be difficult, and we decided that even though it was short we would drive.,

Although this was one of the most expensive rooms during our trip, it was spectacular. The hosts were kind and helpful.  They recommended a small restaurant for dinner that was located in the little village at the base of the hill on which they live that was excellent. The parking in the small driveway was ample and free. The room was absolutely beautiful and spotlessly clean. The TV was excellent with some English channels. The Wi-Fi was fast and free.

The rooms are tastefully decorated with little caring touches, all very clean and with comfortable beds and strong shower. Great value for money, all in all. I was in Brussels to attend a course at the university, and will have to return - will definitely stay here again. Also - the bus from Central Station is really frequent, and the local neighbourhood, Flagey, has a great vibe.",['Leisure trip~Solo traveller~Double Room with Garden View~Stayed 1 night']

Wow!  Amazing property and hosts - wish I could give higher than a 10!,Gîte de l'Espinette,9.3,United Kingdom,10.0,"No complaints, everything was perfect!,

This accommodation was truly amazing and one of the nicest places we have seen, a real home from home.  We stayed 3 nights but would love to have stayed for 3 weeks!  It is a cosy, self-contained property with its own front door and has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and lounge/diner.  Parking is available right outside the door.  The rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated/furnished and the brick ceilings give it a lot of character.  The double bed is very comfortable, blackout blinds keep out the light and the area is silent at night so you get a good nights sleep.  The kitchen is well equipped with microwave, kettle, toaster, fridge, electric hob and all the crockery and utensils you could need.  A breakfast bar makes a handy place to sit and have a drink or a quick snack.  The lounge is very comfortable and a dining table with four chairs is a great place to enjoy a good meal.  The whole property was spotlessly clean, the wifi was good and there are plenty of electric sockets.  The hosts, Virginie and Eric, are lovely people, so friendly and helpful.  They left us a lot of information on the area and were happy to answer any questions that we had.  One of the best parts was the wood stove and free firewood, and Virginie & Eric came in each evening and lit it for us so it was warm and cosy when we arrived back.  The location is great, on the edge of a small village but only a few minutes away from shops and supermarkets.  It is less than 5 minutes from the autoroute which gives quick and easy connections to other parts of Belgium.  A perfect base for exploring Wallonia with plenty to see in the area, and only 20 mins from Brussels Charleroi airport.

Otherwise everything was great. Natasha was a great host, she explained us how to get best to Gent and where to park, what to see etc  and the house was located in a great area with a beautiful garden where we could have our morning coffee and enjoy the winter sun🤗 
It was very close and easy to reach Gent center by car and there was free parking at home, so another plus☺️
We would like to stay there also in spring or summer, we are sure it's going to be even a better experience and we will love it. 
So in general, the neighbourhood, the garden, the room, the bathroom (which is also important for me), all were great!

Rude and stingy owner of a studio without a toilet door!!!,Studio Art-hill,8.1,United Kingdom,4.2,"The room has no door to the toilet given there is no hall area between the bed and the toilet so basically, the person in the room will ""enjoy"" all the pleasantries of another one being in the toilet! Particularly lovely for couples' romantic atmosphere. :((( the entrance to the studio is upstairs, not protected by any fence so at night it was particularly dangerous to walk up and down the stairs. Despite this, the owner strongly recommended to not let the outside lamp on as the light would have bothered someone on the ground floor; funny thing is that underneath the stairs there was just the owner's bathroom so not sure how the light could have bothered anyone unless she didn't sleep in the bath tub. The real reason was very simple - the owner tries to cut costs of absolutely everything! The second proof of this was no heating in the room, it basically stopped after 5 min of work as a thermostat was apparently set on 15 degrees. It was a cold night and the walls were very thin so I had to go downstairs to ask for a portable heater (was asked to not put it on maximum though). Pillows was very uncomfortable, we were lucky having our own ones with us.There were no toiletries (almost empty dispensers, half roll (!) of toilet paper.Please, don't count on breakfast at this premise! For 2 people we got 2 eggs, butter and lots of bread. My husband asked an orange juice but got an expired peach juice. He could have been easily poisoned. Again, the owner is extremely stingy and try to get max profit from the room booking. And the worst part of this stay is the owner's inappropriate comments. After I gave her place a good rate (despite all issues) she sent me a very rude email, see the prints teen attached.Terrible experience, I strongly recommend to stay away from this studio.",['Leisure trip~Couple~King Room with Garden View~Stayed 1 night~Submitted via mobile']

"Decent hotel, but overpriced with few amenities",Orbita Hotel,8.5,Moldova,7.5,"$33 for the cheapest room is too much$10 for breakfast is way too much, the food looks like it belongs in a soviet prisonAll the rooms I stayed in have badly fitted windows, which lets in the cold,wind, and noise. A cheap problem to fix, but they seem not to care.There is a pizza restaurant that looks very uninviting, and there isn't even a menu, I did not take a chance and I suggest you don't take a chance either.There is no restaurants around the hotel unless you call KFC and McDonalds food.The plug in the bath does not fit properly, when you take a bath you need to keep the tap on to compensate for all the water that leaks awayYou have to dial a long number to call reception(which never worked) most normal hotels allow you to just press the 0 button.If you would like to bring someone into your room then the charge is 27 Rubles, which is a little too much, especially if you do it regularlyI left the hotel because I was unhappy with waking up in the morning with no decent food available,

I took the standard single and the rooms are spacious and comfortable with a deskThe bed was pretty comfortable.The bathroom was pleasant and hot water was plentifulThe cleaning lady was very niceThe lobby was spaciousThere is a coffee shop serving good coffee(opens rarely though)The elevators are fastThe staff are mostly goodThey played some good music from the 1980's in the foyer(The Cure for example) which was a pleasant and welcome surprise.The hotel was within spitting distance from Pushkinskaya MetroThe Wifi was good",['Leisure trip~Solo traveller~Standard Single Room~Stayed 1 night']

Average Hotels for Backpackers/Young people,Liège Youth Hostel,8.3,Netherlands,5.4,"We didn't like the sound of the water pipe at night. We thought that someone was using our sink more than 10 minutes, but it was actually the sound of the water pipe in the bathroom (under the sink) which came from the guests above us who were taking a shower in the middle of the night! It was so silly!!! We couldn't sleep nicely at that night (arround 2-3 o'clock in the morning).We didn't like the shower in the bathroom, the floor when it is wet can be so dangerous for the kids. I would not recommend any family with kids to stay here without the floor towel. The bathroom was dirty. It is cleaned necesarilly, not very clean. When we entered our hotel room, we only brought some bed lines without the matrass covers! Then we had to go back to the lobby to take the matras covers. We couldn't also make the baby travel bed ourselves in our hotel room, but the receptionist had helped us after we brought it again to the lobby.We like the breakfast, it has good of choices. We like the main floor (it's design, ineterieurs, furnitures, etc.) from the lobby, the game room, the breakfast room and the hall. We also like the friendly staffs of its hotel. As for the first timers guests who stayed here, we have to adapt ourselves with everything.

"It was all pretty fine, pity of the pool",Renaissance Brussels Hotel,8.2,Netherlands,6.7,"I chose this hotel because of the pool (I filtered and this one showed up) - since I'm 7months pregnant. But a note near the pool said the water in the pool was too cold to swim in, because something was broken. A lady overthere said I could go in at my own risk.There was no note/email upfront or a small briefing when we checked in. Which would have been kind.Therefore we couldn't enjoy a swim. I shared this with the lady of the reception during checkout, but her only response was: ah yes it will be fixed next week. But what's that helping me? No apologies or something.. Normally I wouldn't have cared too much, but now since it was the reason of my choice it wasn't nice.That's the only minor. Besides this, all was well. Just bad luck I guess.,

Room was perfect. Beds were comfy and seperate which we requested for with ny friend.Starbucks coffee.

Disappointing,Hotel Les Nuits,8.4,Hong Kong,4.6,"Very bad experience in staying in this hotel! Not recommend to anyone!
I stayed here for 8 nights, I pre-paid at a time before my Europe trip in July 13, it’s expensive but thought it’s my birthday trip, I didn’t care much about the price. (I stayed in 4-5 starred hotels in my trip from Amsterdam. Rotterdam all the way to Antwerp Belgium) But the total experience with this Les Nuit turned out very unpleasant and even a nightmare.
Here are the stories, for the first 5 nights I was arranged in a dark green room, big bed is fine, like a museum with worn out & old facilities and so-so hygiene,
1. A worn out hairdryer with very awful screaming sound when powered on in the mid night in the empty “museum room”, imagine that. (changed after complain next day)
2. A Tiny shower room/stand without door (separate from toilet). Water splashed all the way outside the tiny shower room and became a big area of watered floor after showers although showered carefully; The small shower head never can sit still in the shower head holder. During the 5th day morning shower, it fell off the shower holder finally and like a sprinkler, water springs all the way up to the ceiling and to wardrobes in the room, my dry hair all wet! After reports to the staff, I got a better bright yellow colored-room instead with a glass doored shower room/stan and bath tub for the rest of my stay (3 nights)
3. The bath tub walls found dirty with skin dirt when trying to use it in the second room. Told them then they clean the next day!
4. Mosquitos found in Both rooms and biting during sleeps. Didn’t tell them but I left the dead big mosquito I killed in the room and stuck  on the tissue, and left on the glass table for them to see it at my last day!
5. Small flying bugs found at breakfast area and the seats are dirty with small pieces of food left over.
6. Last and the worst---bad, rude, arrogant and hostile  attitude of the woman staff who for check out service at my last day.,

Definetly worth it,Snuffel Hostel,8.8,Czech Republic,9.0,"Well, these were just small things. Like the breakfast was that fancy as I expected to be, just a basic one. But the hostel is really big so I guess to feed everyone it's out of budget. But one thing that really brought this one down were the showers. The steam was so small and so weak it was almost impossible to take a proper shower what you would like after a long trip or after a long day out. It was kinda challenging to clean myself for I am big. But that's it, nothing more,

We were lucky enough to catch some Brazilian guys playing whole evening their guitars and singing for us so the atmosphere was absolutly amazing. We had a dance with my girlfriend and it was absolutly amazing. They have good beers on the tap and overal experience was really relaxing. They also have a pool football so it was great fun as well. The common place was really cozy and you felt good in there. Rooms were really big and the beds comfortable. Even the code lockers were really handy.

Breakfast is in the bar on the ground floor and is a good selection of local bakery, good fruit juices, fruit, and fresh good coffee from an espresso machine!

"Beautiful view, nice staff, good breakfast, good location, would definitely stay again.",Hotel Bourgoensch Hof,8.4,United Kingdom,9.0,"A general dearth of plug sockets-one on only one side of the bed, one at an awkward waist-height location with no table nearby, and one in the bathroom. The bathroom also had a see-through door. It was blurry glass, so you couldn't see everything, but it's more than clear enough to see the general shape of your partner sitting on the throne on his ipad. Not to mention, the sound is clear enough to hear through clearly. Kills the romantic vibe somewhat! The coffee tasted like instant, and while the room itself was beautiful, the ground floor hallway looks very scruffy and needs a refurb. I requested a certain room well ahead of time for the cosy aesthetic and the beautiful canal view, and although the staff were able to give it to us, they were unable to confirm it until the day of arrival. As the rooms were not ridiculously expensive but definitely not cheap, I would have been very annoyed to turn up and find out I couldn't have the room and that I had to pay over the odds for a generic-looking hotel room when I could have gone elsewhere for cheaper.,

I requested the ground floor ahead of time and the staff were kind enough to give it to us. The view over the canal, bridges and architecture from this room is beautiful-we did not know until we did a walking tour but the hotel used in the film In Bruges is next door, so the canal we could see from the window was the same canal Colin Farrell jumped into. There are frequently swans and ducks floating about under the window, which was nice. The room was toasty warm at all times even when it was freezing outside, which is great for a basement/ground floor, very clean, the shower was good and there was also a bathtub. There was a lot of lighting in the room-over each side of the bed, the whole bed, the whole room, the table area, the sofa-so you can pick whether you want romantic lighting, reading lights, general light, etc. The bed was huge, and very comfortable. My partner who is a bad sleeper found it excellent for sleeping undisturbed by my moving about or my (alleged) snoring. There is also a sofa which converts to another bed, a small table with two chairs, and another smaller sofa built in to an alcove. Despite all this, there is plenty of floor space because the room is pretty massive. The breakfast was pretty good and varied. There are some lovely bars and squares nearby if you exit and head away from the main square, as well as a good bottle shop, lots of chocolate shops, the torture museum, pretty bridges and a hotel bar (though we didn't go in, it looked good). The wifi was also very good.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Budget Room with River View~Stayed 4 nights']

Excellent B&B base to explore Ieper and surrounding areas.,B&B La Chambre d'Amis,9.7,United Kingdom,10.0,"Could have stayed longer,

A little tricky to find at first as there are many different parts of Vaubanstraat depending on the house number.Once that is known, logical and easy to find, I turned left from the A37 onto Zillibekevoetweg-Steverlyncklaan then further on up the road, turn left into Vaubanstraat by the Volvo garage. La Chambre d'Amis 83A is a short way down, righthand side on the corner, a semi circular modern style property, satnav will probably see you outside number 83 next door.The friendly owner came out to welcome me into a stylish self contained room, with two beds and parking for my vintage motorcycle outside the large window, so you can lie on a bed to gaze at your pride and joy, as owners of vintage vehicles tend to do...The modern bathroom is clean and fresh with an excellent shower and the beds warm and comfortable.Set in a modern well tended area, it feels very safe and secure with a relaxing ambience, especially in the large, well tended lawn, small veg garden and hens in a run which supply your eggs.Breakfast is in your room, with Nespresso machine, milk sachets, sugar, tea, cutlery etc supplied. It arrives at your chosen time in the form of a traditional basket set outside your door and you can smell the warm rolls and croissants as you bring it inside, fantastic! If the weather is good there are seats outside to enjoy the garden as you eat. It,s a pleasant 10 minute walk to the town centre via the Menin Gate, and if you are here to do a poppy run as I do every October, it would be hard to find a nicer place to stay, with friendly, interesting hosts.Roll on next year.",['Leisure trip~Solo traveller~Standard Twin Room~Stayed 2 nights~Submitted via mobile']

We loved the small, cozy cottage!! It had a nice fire place (you can buy wood in the small village), comfortable bathroom with such a good shower !! The bed was very comfy, allthough we brought our own sheets, because we read about the disposable sheets provided.

Parking situation was also not explained although it is worth code and away from thehotel. My bathroom smelled funny. On the third night , after it got hotter outside I had to hold my breath to go in there. Smelled like sulphur. It was better in the morning,  but when I asked for a different room, they simply denied that there was a smell although a young woman who went with me to my room initially said she had smelled it before and could smell it now. While we were at breakfast they sent in someone else and then called to tell me that there was no smell. We left two days earlier than planned as I didn't want to inhale whatever it was for two more nights. There are also an untold number of awkward stairs in the hotel which my elderly mother struggled with. I would not recommend this place to anybody.,

What a disappointment!,Hotel Le Châtelain,8.9,United Kingdom,6.7,"I just spent one night in this hotel and I was on my own. I have been leaving in Brussels for over 20 years and I've passed by this hotel hundreds times but never stayed there so this time I decided to book a night at Le Chatelain. I know it's a 5 stars hotel so I was expecting a 5 stars room. It was a tiny one (which wouldn't have bothered me eventually) located on the 3rd floor and the view from the window was awful a depressing (a dirty grey wall at short distance). See picture attached.I cannot stand air conditioning so I switched it off but a kind of fan noise was still there...and it stayed with me all night, I could hardly sleep a couple of hours. No way to turn it off! I guess it was the bathroom ventilation.The bathroom was also tiny and the pullout shower head located in the bathtub didn't stay properly in place-straight-so I had to hold it in my hands while showering to avoid water going all over the bathroom. I had one nail broken and was looking for a nail file but there wasn't any.

Shame about the hotel - Ypres is lovely.,Hotel Gasthof 't Zweerd,7.7,United Kingdom,4.6,"This was the last room available near to the Menin Gate that accepted dogs. We would have stayed in the same hotel as my son and family but, unfortunately, they didn't accept pets. Our room was clearly meant for family occupation, having two singles and two bunk beds squashed into a dark and dingy room with a view of a partition wall right outside the window. The bathroom was horrible. The door didn't close fully, the lock had been vandalised and there were other signs of damage in the room. My son and family had breakfast with us on one morning and were charged E20 each although there was no charge for the children.  To be fair - we did glimpse (longingly) the rooms at the front of the hotel which overlooked the Grote Market square and they seemed a lot brighter and more acceptable.     We wouldn't stay again however.,

Absolutely  unacceptable. -Secondly, I booked for two people and was given a family room. They made up the room with the sofa bed open and made up for 2 children (which of course we don't have). -No staff gave any hotel or city information. -I also would say the walk to town is a little far - especially if it's raining. -The view out the window was of train tracks and construction mess.,

When it comes to location, this hotel is tops!Service is also very warm and sincere! The lady at the reception is helpful with whatever information you may need and gives out good advise. The room is the largest I've stayed in during this trip. The bathroom is spacious and the room's design is reminiscent of the 50s or 60s which definitely adds to its quaint charm.Hotel Bourgoensch will always be memorable for me since I saw snow start to fall while having my breakfast.

Classic standard place in Antwerp in a quiet (in Winter time at least) but a little bit peripheral quarter (20-30 min walk from Central Station). Still - easy to get to, and bus stops going to Central Station or Berchem 5 minutes away from the place.The quarter itself is very interesting, since it's a cultural mix with people from all over the world, very nice. And a park and spacious squares in the vicinity - good for jogging. Supermarkets close by.Shared bathrooms per floor, and a big nice shared kitchen (with all utensils) on the ground floor.I stayed in a small single room - pretty basic, but not different than any other I stayed in Antwerp throughout the years.Definitely not for staying in for hours, but that's not why you visit Antwerp;)Room, bathroom and the kitchen clean, no issues with that.Host very helpful and quickly responding.",['Business trip~Solo traveller~Deluxe Single Room~Stayed 2 nights']

The hotel is old with little comfort and according to me, I would rank it low w.r.t comfort factor for the price I paid. No common space available and the area is limited including stairways, breakfast room, etc. The bathrooms are old-fashioned. The shower handle was broken and it would take 5 minutes for the hot water to flow from the shower. No shampoo or soap in the bathrooms. The room looks outdated and needs a lot of improvement. The TV was not working at all and I had very Dull lights in the room. Also only dimmed light for the entire bedroom which was ridiculous. No night or reading lights near the cot. The cot was old-fashioned and not comfortable for sleeping.The Wi-Fi connection was slow.No breakfast available during the days I stayed. The cupboards in the room were broken down.

Bus passes once per hour and sometimes not on time (earlier), you will end up awaiting for it more than one hour sometimes or walking more than 1,5 km to get another transport. Taxis also are rare in this part of Antwerp,

The room was confortable, the bathroom was also fine.
The breakfast is very good, many bread options, some fruits, drinks and tasty donuts.

Would stay again,Snuffel Hostel,8.8,Mexico,9.6,"Nothing, really. ,

Room was HUGE, lots of space to place your things and each bed had its individual power outlet and light.Lockers were very big and in separate place from the actual bedroom. When you open the door to your room it's a small room with lockers and then a door to the actual beds. This is a fantastic idea! You can open your bags and arrange your luggage without bothering your roomates. I'm guessing this also minimizes the risk of a guest bringing bed bugs, as their luggage doesn't get in contact with bedding. Breakfast is pretty good too. Staff is nice and since Bruges is pretty small, the location is fine.They have lockers (free of charge) to leave your luggage before or after check in.",['Leisure trip~Solo traveller~Bed in 6 bed mix dorm~Stayed 1 night~Submitted via mobile']

Bathroom was in good order but had been decorated as if in a holiday inn express not an old country house, disappointing.,

Greeted quite grumpily on arrival, i almost felt i should apologize for having disturbed them.  Location is great, the building is fantastic but unfortunately not well maintained or cleaned.  Staff were very helpful when cornered, otherwise they were more than happy to ignore us.  Restaurant and bar only open about 50% of the time, both closed the day we were there.  The room we had was very spacious with comfortable beds and linen, bathroom was relatively newly refurbished, but not in sync with the aesthetic of the rest of the building.

Perfect for stay around Bornem,B&B 't Hoogste,9.7,Belgium,8.3,"Heavy use of conditioner on a bed linens - not all people like strong smells in the bed before sleep. Pillow was too dense and high for my taste - would be great to have a selection as in the room there are extra pillows anyway. A blanket is to warm for me, but I have this issue almost everywhere - growing up behind a polar circuit doesn't help me in this case. Bed cover is that half-synthetic thing with a rubber around mattress, doesn't breath really well, but people there are very used to them, so you'll see them a lot. Room is right under the roof and it could be quite hot inside on a sunny days and small windows won't allow to move this hot air out fast. Overall it all may look small to you and you won't even notice, I believe I've just spoiled myself sleeping on fresh chill air in all-natural bedroom at home, that is why I was too shy to tell Els and Tom all that personally.,

Exceptional breakfast, nice owners, perfect location to work in Bornem. Fast WiFi (~20 Mbps) by local standards, although signal strength could be improved.

Decent.,Hotel Haus Tiefenbach,8.4,Netherlands,6.7,"The rooms we had in the old section of the hotel were a bit dated, but the ones in the newer area looked fine. The main issue with all the rooms were the beds, which were honestly not very good in our experience. Several of us had a poor night sleep due to this. In this price range, you usually get much better beds than this. Another issue we had, which is by no means a fault of the hotel, is the fact that it was a very long drive to the circuit of Spa-Francorchamps where we needed to be. Booking.com reported a 25KM distance, but due to a lack of main roads, this took about 45 minutes. So I would not recommend this hotel if you need to go to the circuit.,

Good,Studio Rempart,8.7,United Arab Emirates,7.9,"I understand the owner does not charge cleaning fees and that is why they are requesting the guests to clean the dishes they use in the small kitchenette, but nothing is stopping them from charging those cleaning fees and save us the trouble of having to wash dishes on our vacation. For a short 2-3 days stay, I found that to not be very enjoyable. A good cutting knife would be handy too since the kitchen is provided, so guests can make better use of it; salt and pepper would have been much appreciated too.
The reason why I mentioned cleaning was not the best is because there were web cobs hanging in the top corner of our door, otherwise the room itself inside felt quite clean.
Wifi not very strong and at some point we couldn't connect to it anymore, not sure if this could have been fixed if we asked for it.
Please note that as the listing says, this studio is in a very old building with very squeaky stairs and flooring, so if you are a light sleeper, this might not be the best place for you, as you can hear people coming in and out of the building, walking around in the apt above or next to you and there is also considerable traffic noise throughout the night coming from the street outside, even with the window open. This was not a major issue for us, but it is important to be mentioned, if you are looking for a quiet accommodation.
Lastly, it needs to be mentioned that the bathroom, although private, inside the room, has a slight feeling that it was later added within the room space, in what might have been a wardrobe, as the doors to the bathroom look like wardrobe doors and they don't really close properly, so it makes for some situations to be a bit uncomfortable - definitely would not recommend it for new couples, unless very comfortable with each other and no privacy issues. It does serve its purpose of having a private bathroom, albeit the shower cabin is tiny, but the water pressure is good, the water was hot and there were plenty of towels...,

The size of the room was great, it also had a nice comfy sofa, the small kitchen had most necessary items and even some jams and chocolate spread available for guests to use - please note there is no stove or toaster available, so maybe not suitable for long stays if you are planning to cook for yourself.Location was good too, not very central, but easy to find at the end of a street coming from the centre. We were able to walk all the time and it wouldn't take us more than say 15 minutes from the grand plaza.I can comfortably say this is very good value for money if you are looking for an authentic experience and staying only for a few days. Communication with the host was also very good.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Studio with Sofa Bed~Stayed 2 nights']

Decent hotel in a bad part of town,Mercure Hotel Brussels Centre Midi,7.8,Netherlands,6.0,"Carpets in general are always outdated and unhygenic, but this one was covered in unknown stains, all across the room. Reading other people's reviews I realised I was not the only one encountering this. I have never seen something like this in Holland. This is unacceptable for a (4-star) hotel. (see photo)While walking around outside its easy to forget that you're actually in Europe; the hotel is close to a train station; at night there are a lot of drug addicts, homeless and gipsies on the streets, sleeping outside or talking to you if you walk by. They come in big numbers. If you travel by car, especially one having a ''foreign'' license plate, it is highly advised to park it in the hotel garage. This costs you €25. Group of men hang around the parked cars outside, I witnessed one urinating against one. I personally wouldn't go out alone at night as a woman or with children. Be aware of pickpockets too.,

Rooms were very quiet, unlike many others hotels in Brussels. Reception staff spoke Dutch like they're supposed to.Overall, I've learnt that booking a hotel is always quite a gamble in Belgium, even at 4-5 star hotels, the quality standard is lower. However this one was decent enough.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Superior Double Room~Stayed 1 night']

Location is central, near Grand Place and Brussels Central station. Breakfast was really good, no deli meats but there were about three kinds of bread, some jams and sweet spreads, juices and hot beverages. In room lockers were really convenient and spacious.

It was only after I told her that I don't need my room to be cleaned for the next 2 days., she decided to give me the 2nd day equivalent of additional towel. It wasn't upsetting, but, I was rather surprised of such attitude, which I am not so used to. Some reception staff were nice, but some weren't so dedicated, and gave me wrong info abt which bus/tram/metro to take where etc. They weren't there just as a security guard, so, I expect them to be more helpful and knowlegeable abt their own city!  Some guests on the same floor were very noisy and drunk from room partying. But, it wasn't as bad as hotels in Amsterdam!!!,

Excellent location, just right next to the main train station within the diamond district, and a few steps from the main avenue with shops and restaurants. The room I stayed wasn't huge, but, cozy, warm, bright enough, and I particularly appreciated the big sink area, with big mirror, where it was possible to spread out make ups and creams and hair arrangement items (good for girls!)

We booked the property because of the light - the images show light coming into those windows. But the owners REFUSED to open the shutters! 
This property is built to the side of the owners' house. They refused to open the shutters for 'privacy'. Don't rent out a house in your garden if you want privacy! (We live in a city and don't care about privacy; we wanted light.)
Also terrible were the kitchen, which had lots of cutlery and crockery but lacked basic cooking utensils or space to put away food, and the downstairs toilet and/or bar drains, which stank.,

- Not suitable for elderly or disabled people
- Not suitable for small children
- Not suitable for people with astma or other longdiseases
- Really small garden which is more smaller than you think because of the fact the owner uses the most part of the garden for own use. Further the garden is full of rocks and therefore not suitable for children. No children playingparts or BBQ in the garden
-Kitchen sink and cookingpart not clean
- Garden roof is full of birdpoop
- No heater only charcoal of which there is no drain! The owner has made a simple drain to the bedrooms upstairs instead a drain outside the home that the smell will go outside the home. So bad for your health! Home is not ventilated and therefore in the morning your mouth smells like tar
- No modern stuff like USB drive, XBox etc.
- No large mirror downstairs in the bathroom or outside the bathroom where the wasmachine is
- House really not regarding environment and health rules
- No nice view. In the garden you only see other houses and from the living room you see the street and other homes
- Area nothing to do, no shops, no baker, no supermarket etc.No bank, no ATM. If something happens there is nobody in the area you can go to/ can help you
- No trafficlights and bad roads so if you come in the dark to the home it is dangerous
- Animals allowed

Convenient location near centre of Mechelen,Hotel Elisabeth,8.2,Belgium,9.6,"Confused that they didn’t know it was the carfree day in Mechelen when we were there and they did not really have advice on whether we would be able to get out by car on the Sunday when I rang to ask about it. In fact they gave us the wrong advice about the timings but that was due to a misprint in local paper. We solved’it ourselves with using town edge parking and taxi.
Bit strange that all the cleaners tackle was just dumped in the corridor next to our room when we arrived and room next to us was wide open and it stayed like that all night, as if cleaner had just downed tools and left.,

No problem that we arrived very late evening after attending a wedding, night staff checked us in cheerily.
View of St Rombauds from window - if you looked along side of building.
Modern room though just a bit cheerless - could do with a bit more colour or decoration.
Modern led lighting strips.
Excellent breakfast though it did cost 18€ per person.
Very easy walking distance to Mechelen sights.
Friendly and helpful staff, had a solution for everything - lockable baggage store available after checkout until we wanted to depart. Helpful in calling us a taxi and suggested we use the lounge bar until taxi arrived on our departure.

The room was dated and dirty. We had no toilet roll. When we left in the morning the sidewalk was awash with  maggots from the bins. I would definitely recommend NOT staying here.

Comfortable stay including many amenities,Marivaux Hotel,8.5,Greece,7.9,"This is a huge hotel, which meant that the elevators and breakfast room were always quite busy and crammed. The building is also a bit old and didn't look like it had been renovated recently-there was also a weird, musty smell around the corridors, at least on the third floor. There are predominantly dark colors, such as deep purple, on the walls and carpets (since there are pictures of actors everywhere, perhaps to resemble a movie theater as a theme?), which makes the inside look a bit gloomy at times. We asked a member of the staff how much a taxi ride to the airport would cost and were told 20-25 euros depending on traffic, whereas the next day, another member of the staff told us it would cost 40-45 euros (it eventually cost 49 euros). Even though these are not major problems, we might choose a more southern point in the city for any future visits, as the area around Marivaux seemed a bit less lively and somewhat rundown (however this is clearly a matter of personal preference).,

We were pleasantly surprised to find how spacious the room was! We also really liked the bed mattresses, which were exactly as firm as they need to be after walking around all day. The room had most probably been renovated and was quite clean. It also came with many amenities such as an espresso machine and espresso capsules, slippers, notepad and pencil, safe, refrigerator, and hangers, all of which were really useful. We particularly appreciated the small, complimentary bottles of water. The desk and closets were also rather big and convenient and there was more than enough room for our luggage. The bathroom was also spacious, with a separate bathtub plus a corner shower in one room and a toilet in a different room. The staff were always very polite and friendly, we couldn't open the refrigerator upon arrival and they fixed it the next morning. Last but not least, the hotel is right next to a subway stop (Rogier) and roughly 12 minutes away from Grand Place on foot.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Standard Double or Twin Room~Stayed 2 nights']

Our concierge Bavo was always available, and helped us in a friendly manner, including some recommendations of the better local fish traiteurs.The best test of hosts is actually when something goes wrong! In our case, the thermostat in the shower stuck - on MAX!! Impossible  to use it! Then the host/concierge team showed their reactiveness, and hands on attitude, giving us a workable shower on a Sunday evening. I very much appreciate this attitude, so thanks Bavo (and your wife) for your Sunday evening plumbing skills!Local supermarkets nearby, free parking, in 100 steps you are on the sand already.

Overall comfortable stay in a conveniently located part of town,Budget Flats Leuven,6.4,Belgium,8.0,"Shower-head suspender was broken off which meant you needed one hand to hold it. Too few settings on the heater made it tricky to get a good temperature that lasted to the morning. No residential computer available. Steep pricing when travelling alone but return-of-value above other accommodations available to me at that time in Leuven. A fair amount of smokers however I smoke myself.,

Well-located room made it easy to get a fresh breeze going, clean and comfortable sofa, retro TV, electric heater with ventilator allowed for quickly warming up the sleeping area. Shared public waste bins allowed for some sorting of household garbage, birds and a half-domestic cat roamed the inner garden area, which had plenty of benches and a stone-grill.

Not worth the cost,Beijing Hotel Minsk,8.9,Lithuania,5.4,"To start with, it was very strange that half of the amenities in the hotel were not working because they were broken / unavailable. I have NEVER encountered this in a 5* hotel. For instance, the bathtub in our room was broken - water was not flowing into the bathtub because the pipes were broken or unattached to the tub, for this reason water was flowing below the tub and not in it. We have checked under the tub and the entire space  was wet and mouldy. The shower head was not very well attached (or full of limescale), so the water was flowing outside the shower head and not through it. The shower tile was chipped. In the men's area of the spa,  jacuzzi was not working. How is this acceptable in a 5* hotel???
The staff appears to be not very well trained. Some members of the staff were very nice and helpful while others were downright rude. We have ordered a couple of items from the mini bar; as the mini bar was not filled upon our arrival, the lady came up to our room carrying all the contents of the mini bar. Trying to save her some trouble, I have told her that we only need a couple of items, so there is no need to fill the entire mini bar. She said quite rudely that this is not a restaurant so I cannot order whatever I want and proceeded to fill the entire mini bar. I am pretty sure that she could approached the matter differently. Some staff members do not speak English. If you address them in English they freak out and pass you along to their colleague. When they do speak English, they come out quite rude, e.g. asking ""what do you want?"" instead of ""how can I help you?"". Again, the lack of proper training is prominent. I have stayed in similarly priced 5* hotels in other countries and the staff goes above and beyond to ensure quality experience for their guests.
To be fair, we have not tried the breakfast, so maybe it would have improved our experience (breakfast was highly rated among other quests).,

I have very mixed emotions about this hotel. While I liked some aspects of it (beautiful lobby, spacious rooms, down pillows and duvet, cleanliness), some things have really let me down.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Standard Double Room~Stayed 1 night']

I understand that times during the quarantine are difficult, but when you charge 700 euros for three nights, perhaps deducting another 100 on top is a bit ridiculous. Something also about us not using our own bed linen (untrue, and a ridiculous claim anyway),

The house was nice, as was the location, but the owner and his cynical ways of trying to squeeze more money out of an already expensive property ruined the trip for us.

This B&B is clearly a labour of love. Sharon is a top-notch host, and one of the sweetest, most caring and sincere owners of a B&B we have met. The exceptionally well maintained and attention is paid to every detail for your experience.   The location, about an 8 min cycle into historical Diest is perfect if you are travelling by bike. There is also a great little grocery store a few minutes walk away if you need any provisions. Water, tea, coffee, milk (for your tea or coffee) and beer are all available for you in the kitchen and Sharon asks you to make yourself at home. There were even chocolates on the bed when we arrived in our room.  The only downside is that there is a shared bathroom, not an issue during our visit since we were the only guests that night but not something we noticed when we booked and something that we usually avoid. Sharon has gone to efforts to make this work with robes in each room for guests transiting to and from the facilities, an ‘in use or available’ sign on the door and space for storage of toiletries etc assigned for each room in the bathroom.Breakfast was excellent with the same attention paid to detail as in all other aspects of our stay.",['Leisure trip~Couple~Double Room with Terrace~Stayed 1 night']
